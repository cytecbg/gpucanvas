Development moved to https://github.com/femtovg/femtovg

**Work in progress!**

Antialiased 2D vector drawing library written in rust.
Ported from https://github.com/memononen/nanovg

Most of the implementation is the same as the original C code with some bug fixes, some features added and several parts have been made more rusty. Rendering is done via one OpenGl (ES) 3.0+ backend.

## Features
* [x] Anti-aliasing
* [x] BÃ©zier paths filling and stroking
* [x] Solid color and image pattern fills and strokes
* [x] Gradients - box, linear (2 points only) and radial
* [x] Stroke width and miterlimit
* [x] Stroke caps: butt, round and square
* [x] Stroke joins: miter, round and bevel
* [x] Fill rules - EvenOdd/NonZero
* [x] Rectangle scissoring
* [x] Composition modes (SourceOver, SourceIn, SourceOut, Atop, etc..)
* [x] Global alpha
* [x] Text filling and stroking
* [x] Text shaping
* [x] Text alignment: (left center right), (top, middle, alphabetic, bottom)
* [x] Nearest font matching
* [x] Path hit testing

## Not supported
* [ ] Stroke dashing
* [ ] Path scissoring
* [ ] Custom shaders
* [ ] 3D transforms
* [ ] OpenGl ES2 backend
* [ ] Color fonts
